Student registration forms are used to register students for classes, tutoring, extracurricular activities, and various school organizations. Whether you’re K-12 or higher education, your school can keep better track of students using our free Student Registration Forms. Students can provide their personal information, upload files, and even submit payments online. Submissions will be sent to your Jotform account, and can then be sent to faculty and student leaders.



Using our intuitive Form Builder, customizing any of our Student Registration Forms is as easy as A-B-C! In just a few clicks, you can add more form fields, a new background image, and your logo for a professional touch. Need to collect registration fees? Integrate your form with a secure payment gateway — Jotform offers more than thirty to choose from, including PayPal and Square. To lessen your workload, you can even integrate your form with apps such as Google Drive or Dropbox to automatically send submissions to your other accounts. When you’re done customizing, publish the form on your school’s website or email a link out to students. By taking your registration process online, our Student Registration Forms work to save precious resources, streamline your workflow, and promote student engagement.
